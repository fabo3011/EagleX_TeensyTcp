# EagleX_TeensyTcp
This repository develops a TCP server and client using the Teensy 3.5 and an Ethernet Board with the ENC28J60 chip and the EtherCard library for Arduino for the EagleX's Rover v3.


This project is part of the Eagle X Control project for the Rover v3

The microcontroller (Teensy 3.5) works as an interface between the rover's main computer (Raspberry Pi 3) and the sensors onboard listed below:

- Adafruit 11 DOF ()
- Adafruit Ultimate GPS v3
- Adafruit Temperature Sensor ()

This microcontroller also controls the rover's motor drivers and robotic arm drivers.
